## Project Description

Imagine that youâ€™ve been tasked with designing and building a Web app for a beach
recommendation system.

- There will be a backend API that you pull data from. Feel free to make assumptions
  here for the sake of the assessment. It can be restful, GraphQL, etc, whatever works
  best for you
- The app will display a scrollable list of beaches, sorted by rating
- Users can click on a beach to see more details. This includes a picture, the aggregate
  rating, and any comments
- Users can rate and comment on beaches

## Project Requirements

Use working code, pseudo-code, descriptions, rough designs, or any combination of those to
show us screens that represent the beach app described above.
